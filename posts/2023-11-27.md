These are some random thoughts when going through [Lecture notes on motivic cohomology](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf). 

# $\mathbb{Z}(1)$ the Tate Twist

Here we review the fact given in the lecture which states that $$
    \mathbb{Z}(1)=\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(\mathbb{G}_m)\cong\mathcal{O}^*[-1]
$$ as presheaves with transfers. Étale sheafication gives that $$
    \mathbb{Z}/l(1)_{ét}\cong\mathcal{O}_{ét}^*[-1]\otimes\mathbb{Z}/l\cong H_0(\mathcal{O}_{ét}^*[-1]\otimes^L\mathbb{Z}/l)=\mu_l.
$$ Note that $\mathcal{O}_{ét}^*[-1]\otimes\mathbb{Z}/l$ is indeed quasi-isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{ét}^*[-1]\otimes^L\mathbb{Z}/l$ when $l$ is prime to the characteristic of our base field $k$.

Moreover, in proposition 10.6 we see that $\mu_n^{\otimes q}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}/n(q)$ is a quasi-isomorphism in $D⁻(Sh_{ét}(Cor_k,\mathbb{Z}/n))$ when $n\in k^\times$. To see this we need some lemmas from the lecture.

#### [Lemma 8.13] If $F$ and $F'$ are étale sheaves sheaves of $R$-modules with transfers, and $F$ is locally constant, then the map$$
    F\otimes_{ét}F'\rightarrow F\otimes_{ét}^{tr}F'
$$ is an isomorphism in $D⁻(Sh_{ét}(Cor_k, R))$.

#### [Lemma 8.18] Let $F$ be a locally constant étale sheaf with $R$-flat sections. Then the object $E\otimes_{L,ét}^{tr}F$ is acyclic at all non-zero degrees.

These two lemmas suggest that locally constant étale sheaves with $R$-flat sections form a model to compute $\otimes_{ét}^{tr}$ in $D⁻(Sh_{ét}(Cor_k, R))$. We may formalute this strictly later on.

Now we easily see that $\mu_$
