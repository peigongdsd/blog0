# Reciprocoity laws

This part is mostly from the note *Reciprocity Laws: Artin-Hilbert* by Parvati Shastri. 

## Kummer theory

Let $n$ be an integer, and $K$ be a field with characteristic different from $n$, which contains all the $n$-roots of $1$. Denote them by $\zeta_n^i$s respectively, and the group of these by $\mu_n$.

#### (Kummer extension) Every Galois extension $L$ of $K$ has Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ iff it is in the form of $K(\alpha^{1/n})$ with $\alpha^{1/d}\not\in K$ for every proper divisor $d$ of $n$.

**proof** If $L$ is such an extension, there is an homomorphism $Gal(L/K)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ given by sending the automotphism which sends $\alpha^{1/n}$ to $\zeta_n^r\alpha^{1/n}$ to $r\in\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, here $\alpha^{1/n}$ is a chosen root of $x^n-\alpha=0$. It's easy to see this is an isomorphism (if not, consider the orbit of roots of $x^n-\alpha=0$).

The inverse statement is more interesting. Let $L/K$ admits a galois group equal to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ with $g$ mapping to $1$. We construct a map $\phi:Gal(L/K)\rightarrow L^\times$ which sends $rg$ to $\zeta_n^r$. View $\phi$ as an element of $C^1(Gal(L/K),L^\times)$ and calculation shows that $d\phi=0$, then $\phi$ comes from $dC^0(Gal(L/K),L^\times)$ or to say there's a $t\in L^\times$ such that $(rg\cdot t)/t=\phi(rg)=\zeta_n^r$. In particular $t^n$ is invariant under $Gal(L/K)$, so now clearly $t$ is our generating element. $\blacksquare$

For such a field, we have a pairing $$ \chi:Gal(\bar{K}/K)\times K^\times\rightarrow\mu_n. $$ Namely, given $\sigma\in Gal(\bar{K}/K)$ and $x\in K^\times$, define $\chi_\sigma(x)=(\sigma\cdot y)/y$ where $y$ is a $n$th root of $x$. Note that this symbol does not depend on the choice of $y$ since $\sigma\cdot\zeta_n^i=\zeta_n^i$. If $x\in K^{\times n}$ then $\chi_\sigma(x)=1$, so $\chi$ factors through $K^\times/K^{\times n}$. Further we have

#### The Kummer pairing induces an isomorphism $$ K^\times/K^{\times n}\rightarrow Hom(Gal(\bar{K}/K),\mu_n) $$ where $Hom$ is considered as morphisms between *continuous* morphisms between topological groups.

Since $\mu_n$ is discrete, this means that every homomorphism in $Hom(Gal(\bar{K}/K),\mu_n)$ remains zero on $Gal(\bar{K}/L)$ for some $L/K$ finite, or to say the $Hom$ set is equal to the colimit of $Hom(Gal(L/K),\mu_n)$. 
**proof** Given $y\in K^\times/K^{\times n}$, $K(y^{1/n})/K$ is a nontrivial Galois extension, so there is an element, say $g\in Gal(K(y^{1/n})/K)$ that doesn't preserve $y$. That is, $\chi_g(y)=(g\cdot y)/y\not=1$. This suggests that the homomorphism is injective. On the other hand, say $f:Gal(\bar{K}/K)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is such a morphism with image group $\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$, denote by $H$ the kernel of $f$ by $L$ the fixed Galois extension of $H$, we see that $Gal(L/K)=\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$ and by Kummer theory $L=K(y^{1/d})$ for some $y\in K$. 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{Gal(\bar{K}/L)} & {Gal(\bar{K}/K)} & {\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}} & {\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["f", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
\end{tikzcd}
```
All the morphisms from $Gal(K(y^{1/d})/K)$ to $\mu_n$ are linearly dependent, so $f$ is some $\chi_\cdot(y^{m/d})$. $\blacksquare$

In spite of this *absolute* case, we have another formulation

#### (Relative case) Subgroups $\Delta$ of $K^\times/K^{\times n}$ correspondes bijectively to $Hom(Gal(K(\Delta^{1/n})/K),\mu_n)$. If $\Delta$ is infinite then the $Hom$ is the set of continuous morphisms.

## Local reciprocity law
Local class field theory stats that there's a functorial isomorphism 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{(K')^\times/N_{L'/K'}(L')^\times} & {Gal(L'/K')} \\
	{K^\times/N_{L/K}L^\times} & {Gal(L/K)}
	\arrow["{r_{L/K}}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{r_{L'/K'}}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{res_{L'/L}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{N_{K'/K}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
\end{tikzcd}
```
for finite abelian extensions of local fields $L/K$ and $L'/K'$ where $L\subset L'$ and $K\subset K'$ are Galois. We now try to investigate a little more about the morphism $r_{L/K}$.
