# Finite extensions of local fields
Say $L/K$ is a finite extension of local fields. Then there is an intermediate extension $L/K'/K$ where $K'/K$ is the unique maximal unramified extension of $K$ in $L$, and $L/K'$ is fully ramified. Let a local field $K$ has finite residue field $k$, then the category of finite unramified extensions of $K$ is equivalant to the category of finite extensions of $k$, which implies that the profinite group $Gal(K^{un}/K)$ is isomorphic to $Gal(\bar{k}/k)$. We know further that every finite field has absolute Galois group isomorphic to $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$, the profinite completion of subgroup $\mathbb{Z}$ which is generated by Frobenius automorphism. For field extension $\mathbb{F}_{q^f}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$, there is an inclusion
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{Gal(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q^f}/\mathbb{F}_{q^f})} & {Gal(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{q})} \\
	{\hat{\mathbb{Z}}} & {\hat{\mathbb{Z}}}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{=}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{=}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\sigma\mapsto f\sigma}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
```
So we finally know everything about the *unramified* part of finite extensions of local fields. What about the *fully ramified* part?

# Newton's polygon trick
Let $K$ be a field endowed with a non-archimedian valuation $\nu_K:K\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$, and let $$
 f(x)=a_nx^n+\cdots+a_1x+a_0\in K[x]
$$ with $a_0a_n\not=0$. Then the Newton polygon is defined to be the lower boundary of the convex hull of the set $P_i=(i,\nu_K(a_i))$, with those zero terms excluded.

We can denote the slops of such line segments by $\mu_1$,$\mu_2$,$\cdots$,$\mu_r$ arranged in increasing order, and the corresponding length of the projected line segments on $X$-axis named $\lambda_1$,$\cdots$,$\lambda_r$. Then we have the following results:

- $\mu_i$s are distinct,
- $\sum_i\lambda_i=n$,
- (Nontrivial) The valuation of every root of $f(x)$ lies in $\{-\mu_1,\cdots,-\mu_r\}$,
- (Still nontrivial) The number of roots with valuation $-\mu_i$ is at most $\lambda_i$, with equality if $f$ splits into linear factors.

If we further ask that $K$ should be Henselian, then we will get a stronger result:

- $f$ is reducible if it's polygon does not reduce to a single segment.

Implied by this, an important statement goes,

- The valuation of a finite extension of local fields $L/K$ is invariant under the action of $Gal(L/K)$.
