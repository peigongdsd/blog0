# The norm
To be precise, the norm structure we hope to have for Milnor K-groups is a morphism $N_{k'/k}:K_n^M(k')\rightarrow K_n^M(k)$ for any finite extension $k'/k$. When over $\mathbb{P}_k^1$, this must behave like a *reciprocity* law, that is, satisfies $$ \sum_\nu N_{\kappa(\nu)/k}(\partial_\nu(\alpha))=0 $$ for every $\alpha\in K_{n+1}^M(L)$ where $L$ is the function field for a certain curve over $k$. Apart from this, it has to satisfies some more properties, that is, 

- functorial: $N_{k'/k}N_{k''/k'}=N_{k''/k}$,
- projection formula: $N_{k'/k}(x\cdot i_{k'/k}(y))=N_{k'/k}(x)\cdot y$ for every finite (simple) extension $k'/k$. (Well we'd better stick to separable extensions at this time)

This norm construction appears firstly in [BT73], which is proved by the steps

- Construct the norm: For any finite extension $k'/k$, embed $k'$ in $k(t)$ at valuation $\mu$. Then we see the diagram
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{K_{n+1}^M(k)} & {K_{n+1}^M(k(t))} & {\oplus_{\nu\not=\infty} K_n^M(\kappa(\nu))} \\
	&& {K_n^M(\kappa(\infty))}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\oplus\partial_\nu}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\partial_{deg}}"', from=1-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["{\oplus N_\nu}", dashed, from=1-3, to=2-3]
\end{tikzcd}
```
induces all the *norm*s, so take $\nu$ to be $\mu$. Clearly this satisfies the reciprocity law, at least for $k(t)$.

- This is the tricky part: prove those $N_\nu$ do not actually depend on our selection of the embedding, or to prove this is the *only* correct norm.

To tell the truth, I don't like this proof, which seems to be in much chaos and is not so enlightening. It has long be known that we can interpret Milnor K-groups (even algebraic K, but too far-reaching) in the terms of intersection theory, and [MVW06] gives a construction showing $$ H^{n,n}(k,\mathbb{Z})=K_n^M(k) $$ where $H^{n,n}$ is the motivic cohomolgy. However, his proof is not so satisfying, since his construction of a pair of morphisms between motivic cohomology and Milnor K is depending on the existence of the norm map and Weil recprocity. So I decided to (try to) develop an alternative apporach that does not really requiring *any* preliminary knowledge about the Milnor K. Wish me good luck and forward!

# Singular homology
Following [SV96], fix a base field $k$ and all the schemes are considered being locally of finite type over $k$, which means that dimensions behave well. Define the $n$-simplex $\Delta_k^n$ as the hypersurface $\mathbb{A}_k^{n+1}/(T_0+\cdots+T_n-1)$. With the obvious face $\partial_i$ and degeneracy $s_i$ maps this turns out to be a cosimplicial object. For any $X\rightarrow Y$ over $k$, define $C_0(X/Y)$ to be the abelian group generated by cycles on $X$ which are finite and surjective over $Y$. Furthermore we let assign a simplicial object $C_\bullet(X/k)$ to $X/k$ namely $C_n(X/k)=C_0(X\times\Delta^n/\Delta^n)$. Finally we assign obvious complex $C_*(X/k)$ (with differentials as alternating face sums) to $X/k$ and our **singular homology** $H_i^{sing}(X/k)$, or $H_i(X/k)$ if there's no danger of confusion, is defined to be the homology of such complex. The base scheme $S$ in $C_\bullet(X/S)$ controls the dimension really well and for a cover $U\coprod V\rightarrow X$ we have Mayer-Vetoris 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	0 & {C_\bullet(U\cap V)} & {C_\bullet(U)\oplus C_\bullet(V)} & {C_\bullet(X)} & 0
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["diag", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{(+,-)}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
\end{tikzcd}
``` 
and
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	\cdots & {H_1(U\cap V)} & {H_1(U)\oplus H_1(V)} & {H_1(X)} & {} \\
	{} & {H_0(U\cap V)} & {H_0(U)\oplus H_0(V)} & {H_0(X)} \\
	{} & 0
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow[from=3-1, to=3-2]
	\arrow["\delta", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["\delta", from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
```


We now define $\mathbb{G}_m$ to be $\mathbb{A}_k^1\backslash\{0\}$, and $(\mathbb{G},*)$ be the virtual scheme which maps to the cokernel of 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	0 & {C_*(k/k)} & {C_*(\mathbb{G}_m/k)} & 0
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["1", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
\end{tikzcd}
```
We may say that $\mathbb{G}_m$ is *pointed* (in this case, by $1:*\rightarrow\mathbb{G}_m$) and $(\mathbb{G},*)$ is *punctured*. 

### Calculation of $H^{sing}_i(\mathbb{G}_m,*/k)$
Following [SV96] we know that $H_i(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$ is $\mathbb{Z}\oplus k^*$ when $i=0$ and $0$ otherwise. We may just use this conclusion since the higher homology group is not so straightforward to calculate, but rather do some small observations on $H_0$. By definition $H_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$ is the cokernel of 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{C_0(\mathbb{G}_m\times\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{A}^1)} & {C_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)}
	\arrow["{\partial_0-\partial_1}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}
```
$C_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$ is very easy since every integral subscheme of $\mathbb{G}_m$ of codimension $1$ is indeed represented by $f(t)=t^n+\cdots a_0\in k[t]$ where $a_0\not=0$. What about $C_1(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$? Thanks to the smoothness, a codim $1$ cycle $Z$ of $\mathbb{G}_m\times\mathbb{A}^1$ can be represented by some $g(t,x)=b_n(x)t^n+\cdots b_0(x)\in k[t,x]$ where $b_0(x)b_n(x)$ is not zero. The requirement that $Z$ being surjective over $\mathbb{A}^1$ is equivalent to say that those $b_i(x)$ cannot be trivial at the same time, and being *finite* requires V.Voedosky's small trick: we may view $\mathbb{G}_m\times\mathbb{A}^1$ as an open subscheme of $\mathbb{G}_m\times\mathbb{P}^1$, and $Z$ being finite is equivalent to being *closed* in those two schemes both, or to say $Z$ coincides with it's own projective closure. The only two suspecious points to check is $t=0$, which means $b_0(x)\in k^*$, and $t=\infty$, which means that $b_n(x)\in k^*$. We may further assume that $b_n(x)=1$, then $\partial_0-\partial_1$ gives $$
  D(t^n+\cdots+b_0)\sim D(t^n+b_0)
$$ This means that the *only* remaning information in $H_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$ coming from $C_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)$ is just degree and the coefficient of constant term, that is, $\mathbb{Z}\oplus k^*$. We'd rather take the second term to be $(-1)^na_0$ to match the intuition of the product of all positions of the roots.

What about the punctured one $H_0(G_m,*/k)$? We know that the point object $C_\bullet(k/k)$ is constant as $\mathbb{Z}$, and the point takes $n$ to $(x-1)^n$. By modding out this degree $1$ term in the exact sequence
$$ \cdots\rightarrow H_0(k/k)\rightarrow H_0(\mathbb{G}_m/k)\rightarrow H_0(\mathbb{G}_m,*/k)\rightarrow 0 $$ we see immediately that $H_0(\mathbb{G}_m,*/k)=k^*$. The same long exact sequence also suggests that higher homology groups of $(\mathbb{G}_m,*)$ vanishes, just as $\mathbb{G}_m$'s do.
