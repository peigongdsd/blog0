# Basics in geometry of curves

Given a smooth curve $C$ over a field $k$, the canonical bundle $K$ is just the bundle of $1$-forms, namely $\Omega_{C/k}^1$. Moreover if $C/k$ is proper, then for any divisor $D$ we have Riemann-Roch
$$ l(D)-l(K-D)=deg(D)-g+1 $$
where $l(\bullet)$ stands for $\dim\Gamma(C,\mathcal{O}(\bullet))$, and $g$ is the genus. In the case of varieties over $\mathbb{C}$, the (arithmetic) genus is just $h^1(C,\mathcal{O}_C)$. In fact, according to Serre duality, $l(K-D)=h^0(\Omega_{C/k}^1\otimes\mathcal{O}(D)^\vee)=h^1(\mathcal{O}(D))$. Therefore the left side is just $\chi(\mathcal{O}(D))$. The generalized form, Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, states that for a vector bundle $E/C$ of rank $n$ and degree $d$ (the degree of the first Chern class $c_1(E)\in CH_0(C)$) we have
$$ \chi(C,E)=ch(Rf_*E)=f_*(ch(E)\cdot td(T_{C/k}))=d+n(1-g) $$
where $f:C\rightarrow k$ is the structural morphism.

# Normalization of a curve
It should hold for a curve that the difference $p_a(C)-p_g(C)$ is equal to the number of points of singular locus of $C$, which shall vanish after a normalization namely 
$$ \tilde{C}\xrightarrow{f} C $$
and the geometric genus $p_g(\bullet)$ is birationally invariant.

We can say even more about the normalization map. In fact, $f$ is uniquely determined by the properties of being finite, birational and $\tilde{C}$ being normal. If $C$ is the union of irreducible components $C_1\cdots C_n$, then $\tilde{C}$ is the disjoint union of $\tilde{C}_i$s (this can be deduced easily from the determining properties above). 

# Genus of (smooth) complete intersections


# Curves on Surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$
Let $S=S_d$ be a smooth surface of degree $d$, embedded in $\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{C}^3$. By Noether-Lefschetz, if $d\geq 4$ and $S_d$ is general then every curve $C$ on $S_d$ is a scheme-theoretic intersection $C=S_d\cap H_m$ where a degree $m$ surface $H_m$. Now we do normalization $\tilde{C}\rightarrow C$ to get a smooth curve, and we may ask about the genus $g(\tilde{C})$. If $C$ is already smooth, now $g(\tilde{C})=g(C)$
