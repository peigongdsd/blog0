V.Voevodsky's theory of preasheaves with transfers depends on a particular version of the intersection theory, that is, the version focus on cycles instead of their rational equivalance classes. However, it happens to be quite trivial and annoying when one tries to work on a consistent foundation while manipulating cycles, which are viewed as (locally finite) linear combinations of integral subschemes. However, the situation may be slightly saved if we work over the $K_0$ group of coherent sheaves instead, with the filtration defined by codimension of their supports.
