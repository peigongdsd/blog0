# The big picure in a nutshell
Following V.Voevodsky and A.Suslin, we have a nice theory of singular homology of a variety. Assume $X/k$ is a variety over some field $k$, denote by $C_\bullet(X/k)$ the simplicial set associated to $$ n\mapsto C_0(X\times\Delta_k^n/\Delta_k^n) $$ with the obvious face/degenerecy maps, where $C_0(X/Y)$ is defined to be the subset of cycles on $X$ which are finite and surjective over $Y$, giving $X$ is over $Y$. The homology of the associated complex $C_*(X/k)$ is then denoted by $H_*^{sing}(X/k)$. If we form a base change of $C_\bullet(X/k)$ over some new ring $R/\mathbb{Z}$, we then get a homology $H_*^{sing}(X/k,R)$ with coefficients in $R$. [MVW06] tells us that for $X/k$ a smooth variety over a separably closed field $k$ we have a perfect pairing $$ H_p^{sing}(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}/n}H_{et}^p(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}/n $$ where $n$ is prime to characteristic of $k$. Take $k$ as $\mathbb{C}$ then this is the main result of [SV96]. 

Now fix a base field $k$. The pointed simplicial set $$ 0\rightarrow C_\bullet(k)\rightarrow C_\bullet(\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow 0 $$ which is denoted by $C_\bullet(\mathbb{G}_m,*)$ admits a exponential of smash product, namely $$ C_\bullet(\mathbb{G}_m^{\wedge n},*) $$ is taken to be the $n$-fold *inner* tensor product of $C_\bullet(\mathbb{G}_m,*)$, or the cokernel of 
$$ \oplus_i C_0(\mathbb{G}_m\times\cdots\times\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m\times\cdots\times\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow C_0(\mathbb{G}^{\times n}_m). $$ Here the word *inner* is stressed for that dispite we have a Kunneth formula $C_\bullet(X)\otimes C_\bullet(Y)=C_\bullet(X\times Y)$ for topological spaces, the same equation has no chance to hold in the algebro-geometry context. (To attack this, an obvious approach is to consider not the native tensor product, but a *symmetric monoidal structure* on those simplicial objects, which is defined directly to fullfill the Kunneth formula. This technology is used in [MVW06].) There is a interesting relationship between singular homology and Milnor K-groups, namely $$ H_0^{sing}(\mathbb{G}^{\wedge n}_m,*/k)=K_n^M(k). $$ This note is to explore the relationship between those two groups in detail, focusing on the correspondence of operations between these two structures, which leads to a further observation on Weil reciprocity.

# Milnor K-groups of a field

The main reference for this and the following part is [norm.pdf](https://web.math.ku.dk/~trk734/teaching/F2005_917/norm.pdf) and [Mil70].

Given a field $k$, the Milnor K-ring $K_*^M(k)$ is defined to be the quotient of free tensor algebra $\otimes k^*$ over the units of $k$ by $(u\otimes v)$ where $u+v=1$ in $k$. The part just quotient out by us is a ideal generated by a degree $2$ element, so we have $K_0^M(k)=\mathbb{Z}$ and $K_1^M(k)=k^*$. Denote by $l(\cdot)$ the morphism sending $k^*$ to $K_1^M(k)$, and the higher part of $K_*^M(k)$ is referred to as $l(x_1)l(x_2)\cdots l(x_t)$, omitting the tensor operator. 

### Some computations
- $l(-x)=l(1-x)-l(1-x^{-1})$, therefore $l(x)l(-x)=l(x)l(1-x)+l(x^{-1})l(1-x^{-1})=0$.
- $l(x)l(y)+l(y)l(x)=l(x)l(-x)+l(x)l(y)+l(y)l(x)+l(y)l(-y)=l(xy)l(-xy)=0.$ 
- $l(x)l(x)=l(x)(l(-1)+l(-x))=l(x)l(-1)$, which is not necessarily zero.

### The $\partial_v$ (boundary? specialization?) construction
For a field $L$ together with a specific normalized descrete valuation $\nu$, we associate a canonical morphism between Milnor K-groups, namely $$ \partial_v: K_{n+1}^M(L)\rightarrow K_n^M(\kappa(\nu)). $$

Possibly invented by Serre, the trick is introducing a virtual element $\epsilon$ of degree $1$, which **commutes with every element**, to $K_*^M(\kappa(\nu))$. Take a prime element $\pi$, define a morphism $\theta_\pi:K_*^M(L)\rightarrow K_*^M(\kappa(\nu))[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2-l(-1)\epsilon)$ to be $$ \theta_\pi(l(x))=\theta_\pi(l(\pi^{\nu(x)}x_0))=l(\bar{x_0})+\nu(x)\epsilon $$ and always being zero on the zero slice. We have to verify that this morphism is well defined, implied by $\theta_\pi(l(a)l(1-a))$ is $0$ indeed. Fix a pair $(x,y)$ in $k^*$ satisfies $x+y=1$, we may assume that $\nu(x)\leq\nu(y)$. Then there're three cases

- $0<\nu(x)\leq\nu(y)$. Impossible.
- $\nu(x)\leq 0<\nu(y)$. We see immmedietaly that $\nu(x)=1$ and $\bar{x}=1$. This indicates that $\theta_\pi(l(x))=0$.
- $\nu(x)\leq\nu(y)\leq 0$. There must be $\nu(x)=\nu(y)$ and $\bar{x_0}+\bar{y_0}=0$. Simple calculation goes $$
\begin{aligned}
    \theta_\pi(l(x)l(y))&=(l(\bar{x_0})+\nu(x)\epsilon)(l(\bar{y_0})+\nu(y)\epsilon)\\ &=l(\bar{x_0})l(-\bar{x_0})+\nu(x)(\nu(x)+1)\epsilon(l(-1))\\ &=0.
\end{aligned}
$$ Just notice that $\nu(x)(\nu(x)+1)$ is always even.

Now we have a well defined $\theta_\pi$, and $\partial_\nu(\alpha)$ is defined to be the coefficient of $\epsilon$ in $\theta_\pi(\alpha)$ for a symbol $\alpha$. However, it's unknown that whether this $\partial_\nu$ is dependent on the choice on a prime element $\pi$. This is verified using induction. In the case where $n=0$, $\partial_v(l(x))=\nu(x)$ which depends only on the valuation. Now *\*stupid routine calculation omitted\**🤣.

Note that when $n=2$, $\partial_v$ degenerates to the tame symbol $$ \partial_v(\cdot,\cdot):L^*\times L^*\rightarrow\kappa(\nu) $$
calculated as $\partial_v(x,y)=(-1)^{\nu(x)\nu(y)}x^{\nu(y)}y^{\nu(x)}$.

We may define a new symbol $\psi_\pi(x)=\theta_\pi(x)-\epsilon\partial_\nu(x)$. To be concise, $\psi_\pi(l(\pi^rx_0))=l(\bar{x_0})$ and $\psi_\pi(x)\psi_\pi(y)=\psi_\pi(xy)$.

An observation goes that given a prime $\pi$ for some valuation $\nu$, The group $K_n^M(L)$ is generated by $l(\pi)l(g_2)\cdots l(g_n)$, which is calculated as $l(\bar{g_2})\cdots l(\bar{g_n})$ under $\partial_\nu$, where $\nu(g_i)=0$ for all $i$. To see this, just notice that $l(\pi)l(\pi)=0$ and use the $\theta_\pi$ extension. Here's an application. For a finite extension $L/K$, together with valuations $\nu$ and $\mu$ on $L$ and $K$ resp. such that $\nu$ lies over $\mu$, we have the diagram
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{K_{n+1}^M(K)} & {K_n^M(\kappa(\mu))} \\
	{K_{n+1}^M(L)} & {K_n^M(\kappa(\nu))}
	\arrow["{i_{L/K}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{e\cdot i_{\kappa(\nu)/\kappa(\mu)}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\partial_\mu}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\partial_\nu}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
```
Where $e$ is the ramification index of $\nu$ over $\mu$. The diagram commutes since $$ \partial_\nu(l(\pi_\mu)l(g_2)\cdots l(g_n))=e\cdot l(\bar{g_2})\cdots l(\bar{g_n}). $$

### The split exact sequence

Given a field $k$, there is a split exact sequence
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	0 & {K_{n+1}^M(k)} & {K_{n+1}^M(k(t))} & {\oplus_\nu K_n^M(\kappa(\nu))} & 0
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{i_{k(t)/k}}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\oplus\partial_\nu}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
\end{tikzcd}
```
Well on the first sight this seems quite "ungeneral", what's the difference between $(t^{-1})$ and valuations on $\mathbb{P}^1$? Why not an arbitary curve over $k$? Well, the very properties we're actually using are

- $k(t)$ is UFD,
- $(t^{-1})$ is a rational point,
- the prime ideal corresponding to every valuation other than $t^{-1}$ can be somehow uniquely written principle as $(f)$ with $f$ having a negative valuation under $\nu_{t^{-1}}$.

In other words, if we wants to choose another valuation, it must behaves like a *degree* for polynomials. We do not do the generalization here, but only recite the proof by Milnor and Tate. 

Firstly, $i_{k(t)/k}$ has a split, namely $\psi_{t^{-1}}$ which sends $l(f)$ to $l(c_f)$ where $c_f$ is the leading coefficient of $f$. We then introduce a filtration $$ L_0\subset L_1\subset\cdots\subset K_{n+1}^M(k(t)) $$ where $L_d$ is the subset of $K_{n+1}^M(k(t))$ generated by $l(g_1)\cdots (g_{n+1})$ where $deg(g_i)$ is no more than $d$. It's obvious that $L_0=K_{n+1}^M{k}$ is the image of $i_{k(t)/k}$, and we now construct a homomorphism
$$ h_\nu:K_n(M)(\kappa(\nu))\rightarrow L_d/L_{d-1} $$ where $\nu$ is corresponding to a degree $d$ monic polynomial $\pi$ (this is uniquely determined), as $$ h_\nu:l(g_1)\cdots l(g_n)\mapsto l(\pi)l(g_1)\cdots l(g_n).$$ This make sense since $g_i$s are of degree stricly less than $d$. To see this is a homomorphism, assume that $g\equiv g'g''(mod\ \pi)$, then we have $$ g=f\pi+g'g'' $$ where $deg(f)<d$, it's clear that $$ 0=(l(f)+l(\pi)-l(g))(l(g')+l(g'')-l(g))\equiv l(\pi)(l(g')+l(g'')-l(g))(mod\ L_{d-1}). $$ 

Secondly, based on the $h_\nu$ we have constructed, for *degree $d$* valuations $\nu$ and $\nu'$ the composition
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{K_{n}^M(\kappa(\nu))} & {L_d/L_{d-1}} & {K_{n}^M(\kappa(\nu'))}
	\arrow["{h_\nu}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{\partial_{\nu'}}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}
``` 
(Well, $\partial_\nu$ is obviously zero on $L_{d-1}$!) is either identity or zero given $\nu$ and $\nu'$ match or not. Now take a non-zero object in $L_d/L_{d-1}$, say $l(f_1)\cdots l(f_s)l(g_{s+1})\cdots l(g_{n+1})$ where $deg(f_i)=d$ and $deg(g_i)<d$. Now we reduce $s$ to $1$ and assume that $s=2$. Set $f_2=-af_1+g$ then $$ (l(a)+l(f_1)-l(g))(l(f_2)-l(g))=0 $$ and as a result $l(f_1)l(f_2)$ can be written into producted pairs with only one term of degree $d$. Now $L_d/L_{d-1}$ is generated by terms like $l(f_1)l(g_2)\cdots l(g_{n+1})$, and our assemption for the non-zeroness of which implies that $f_1=a\pi$ for some monic irreducible polynomial $\pi$. This implies that $L_d/L_{d-1}$ is generated by the image of $\oplus_d h_\nu$, or to say that $L_d/L_0$ is generated by the image of $\oplus_{\leq d} h_\nu$. Take the colimit and we see the split exact sequence.
