In this note we will investigate the rigidity related to $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopical invariance. The main reference is still [Lecture notes on motivic cohomology](/assets/LectureNotesOnMotivicCohomology.pdf). 

We already know that the category of étale (rel, Nisnevich) motive is constructed from a series of localizations 
```rawlatex
\begin{tikzcd}
	{PST(k,R)} && {D_\tau^-(k,R)} \\
	{(Cor_k,\otimes,R)} && {D_\tau^{eff,-}(k,R)} \\
	& {D^-Sh_{\tau}(Cor_k,R)}
	\arrow["DervCat"{description}, from=2-1, to=3-2]
	\arrow["{\mathbb{A}^1-weak\ equiv}"{description}, from=3-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["{\tau-Sheafication}"{description}, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{Tate\ Twist}"{description}, from=2-3, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}
