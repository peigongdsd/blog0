# Covariant Motives

(Just the inverse category of the category of pure motives, but let's rephrase it)


# Structure of the Pure Motive of a Curve

Over a field $k$. Say there is a (geometrically integral) smooth proper curve $C/k$. Hence the field of constants of $C$ is just $k$. Suppose there is a rational point 

$$ k\xrightarrow{\alpha} C\xrightarrow{struc} k $$

We see immediately that $h(C)$ admits a direct summand of $h(k)$. Moreover, take the transportation of the morphisms above, we have

$$ k\xrightarrow{struc^t} C\xrightarrow{\alpha^t} k $$

Let $d=\mathrm{dim}(C)$, by passing to the category of covariant motives we have 

$$ h(struc^t)\in\mathrm{Corr}_{d}(k,C)\\ h(\alpha^t)\in\mathrm{Corr}_{-d}(C,k) $$

so we have another composition calculates to identity, namely

$$ h(k)\xrightarrow{h(struc^t)} h(X)\xrightarrow{h(\alpha^t)} h(k) $$
