(Excercise) If $k\subset F$ is a field extension, there is an additive functor 

$$ Cor_k\rightarrow Cor_F $$

sending $X$ to $X_F$, and the cycle $W\in Z(X\times_k Y)$ to $[W\times_kF]\in Z(X_F\times_F Y_F)$. 

If $F$ is finite and separable over $k$, there is an additive functor $Cor_F\rightarrow Cor_k$ sendinf $U/F$ to $U/k$ (separatedness for smoothness). These are adjoint: if $U$ is smooth over $F$ and $X$ is smooth over $k$, there is a canonical identification

$$ Cor_F(U,X_F)=Cor_k(U,X). $$

This is kinda obvious since $U\times_F(X\times_kF)\simeq U\times_k X$.

1. Let $F$ be a field extension of $k$ and $X$ and $Y$ two smooth schemes over $k$. Write $X_F$ for $X\times_kF$ and so on, show that $Cor_F(X_F,Y_F)$ is the limit of $Cor_E(X_E,Y_E)$ as $E$ ranges over all finitely generated field extensions of $k$ in $F$.

If $F/k$ is finite this is obvious. Say if a scheme $X/k$ is of finite type (this is the assumption we take at the starting), an ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}$ on $X_F$ is locally determined by a quotient

$$ \mathcal{O}_U^{\oplus n}\xrightarrow{some\ sections}\mathcal{O}_U\rightarrow\mathcal{I}\rightarrow 0 $$

with $n$ finite (Noetherian). Due to the assumption that $X$ is quasi-compact, there are in total finitely many local sections determining $\mathcal{I}$, so take $E/k$ to assure that those sections are all in $X_E$. Furthermore, every primary cycle lies in an affine (hence quasi-compact) local so we can push this to locally-of-fintie-type case. Now take $X$ to be $X\times_kY$.

2. Let $X\rightarrow S\rightarrow k$ be smooth morphisms with $S$ connected, and let $F$ denote the function field of $S$. For every smooth scheme $Y$ over $k$, show that
