1. Let $x$ be a closed point of $X$, considered as a correspondence from $k$ to $X$. Then the composition $k\rightarrow X\rightarrow k$ is multiplcation by $[\kappa(X):k]$ and $X\rightarrow k\rightarrow X$ is $X\times x\subset X\times X$.

This is easy.

2. Let $L/k$ b a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. Prove that $Cor_k(L,L)\simeq\mathbb{Z}[G]$  (just count the points) and $L\rightarrow k\rightarrow L$ is $\sum_{g\in G}g\in\mathbb{Z}[G]$. Then show  that $Cor_k(k,Y)\simeq Cor_k(L,Y)^G$ for every $Y$.

(Excercise) If $k\subset F$ is a field extension, there is an additive functor 

$$ Cor_k\rightarrow Cor_F $$

sending $X$ to $X_F$, and the cycle $W\in Z(X\times_k Y)$ to $[W\times_kF]\in Z(X_F\times_F Y_F)$. 

If $F$ is finite and separable over $k$, there is an additive functor $Cor_F\rightarrow Cor_k$ sendinf $U/F$ to $U/k$ (separatedness for smoothness). These are adjoint: if $U$ is smooth over $F$ and $X$ is smooth over $k$, there is a canonical identification

$$ Cor_F(U,X_F)=Cor_k(U,X). $$

This is kinda obvious since $U\times_F(X\times_kF)\simeq U\times_k X$.

(Excercise)

1. Let $F$ be a field extension of $k$ and $X$ and $Y$ two smooth schemes over $k$. Write $X_F$ for $X\times_kF$ and so on, show that $Cor_F(X_F,Y_F)$ is the limit of $Cor_E(X_E,Y_E)$ as $E$ ranges over all finitely generated field extensions of $k$ in $F$.

If $F/k$ is finite this is obvious. Say if a scheme $X/k$ is of finite type (this is the assumption we take at the starting), an ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}$ on $X_F$ is locally determined by a quotient

$$ \mathcal{O}_U^{\oplus n}\xrightarrow{some\ sections}\mathcal{O}_U\rightarrow\mathcal{I}\rightarrow 0 $$

with $n$ finite (Noetherian). Due to the assumption that $X$ is quasi-compact, there are in total finitely many local sections determining $\mathcal{I}$, so take $E/k$ to assure that those sections are all in $X_E$. Furthermore, every primary cycle lies in an affine (hence quasi-compact) local so we can push this to locally-of-fintie-type case. Now take $X$ to be $X\times_kY$.

2. Let $X\rightarrow S\rightarrow k$ be smooth morphisms with $S$ connected, and let $F$ denote the function field of $S$. For every smooth scheme $Y$ over $k$, show that 

$$ Cor_F(X\times_S) $$

## Etale sheaf

### 6.2
(Lemma) For any scheme $T/k$, $\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(T)$ is an etale sheaf.

proof. Let $X$ be connected and smooth over $k$ with connected etale cover $U\rightarrow X$. As $U\times T\rightarrow X\times T$ is flat and surjective, the pullback of cycles is well-defined and is an injection. The statement of being a sheaf requires the exactness of

$$ 0\rightarrow Cor_k(X,T)\rightarrow Cor_k(U,T)\rightarrow Cor_k(U\times_XU,T). $$

Now we need only to verify the exactness at $Cor_k(U,T)$. Take $Z_U$ in $Cor_k(U,T)$ whose image in $Cor_k(U\times_XU,T)$ vanish. Denote by $F$ and $L$ the function fields of $X$ and $U$ respectively. Using [1.11] we know that 

$$ Cor_F(F,T_F)\rightarrow Cor_F(L,T_F)\rightrightarrows Cor_F(L\otimes_FL,T_F) $$

is an equilizer diagram. Now $Z_L$, the fibre of $Z_U$ at $L$, vanishes in $Cor_F(L\otimes_FL,T_F)$ and hence there is a Zariski open $V\subset X$ and a cycle $Z_V$ in $Cor_k(V,T)$ agreeing with $Z_U$ in $Cor_k(U\times_XV,T)$.
