## Enriques Surface

**Earlier Answer (on existence of torsion in Néron–Severi groups):**

Yes. A classic example is an **Enriques surface** (over an algebraically closed field, char ≠ 2). For an Enriques surface $X$, the canonical bundle is nontrivial but
$$2K_X \sim 0,$$
so the class of $K_X$ is a nonzero 2-torsion element in $\mathrm{NS}(X)$. In fact the geometric Picard/Néron–Severi group is
$$\mathrm{NS}(X)\ \cong\ \mathbb Z^{10}\ \oplus\ \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z,$$
with the $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ generated by $K_X$.

There are also **bielliptic (Bagnera–de Franchis) surfaces** whose Néron–Severi groups contain torsion; depending on the type one can get $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^2$, $\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$, etc. (so $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ certainly occurs).

For contrast, on **abelian varieties** the Néron–Severi group is torsion-free.

**Detailed Enriques Example:**

Below is a detailed explanation of the Enriques example with proper LaTeX style formatting.

### 1) What an Enriques surface is (and its torsion)

A (classical) Enriques surface $S$ (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2$) is a smooth projective surface with

* $q(S)=h^1(\mathcal O_S)=0$,
* $p_g(S)=h^0(K_S)=0$,
* $2K_S \sim 0$ but $K_S \not\sim 0$.

Hence $K_S$ is a nontrivial $2$-torsion line bundle. Because $q=0$ we have $\mathrm{Pic}^0(S)=0$, so $\mathrm{NS}(S) \cong \mathrm{Pic}(S)$; the torsion in $\mathrm{NS}(S)$ is therefore exactly the class $\langle K_S\rangle \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$. Modulo torsion,
$$\mathrm{Num}(S) = \mathrm{NS}(S)/\mathrm{Tors} \ \cong\ E_8(-1)\ \oplus\ U,$$
(an even unimodular lattice of signature $(1,9)$).

### 2) Why $K_S$ is $2$-torsion via the K3 cover

Every Enriques surface $S$ admits an étale double cover $\pi: X \to S$ with $X$ a K3 surface; conversely, the quotient of a K3 surface by a fixed-point-free involution (an “Enriques involution”) is an Enriques surface. For that étale cover,
$$\pi^*K_S \cong K_X \cong \mathcal O_X,$$
so $K_S$ pulls back to the trivial bundle — hence $K_S$ is $2$-torsion. It is nontrivial because $p_g(S) = h^0(K_S) = 0$ (if $K_S$ were trivial, we would get $p_g = 1$).

### 3) An explicit model you can write down

One hands-on construction is: start with a K3 surface in $\mathbb P^5$ and divide by a free involution.

* **K3 with a free involution.** Let
  $$
  X := (P_1(u,v,w) + Q_1(x,y,z) = 0,\\ P_2(u,v,w) + Q_2(x,y,z) = 0,\\ P_3(u,v,w)+Q_3(x,y,z)=0)\subset \mathbb P^5,$$
  where $P_i, Q_i$ are general quadrics in the indicated variables. Define the involution
  $$
  \iota : (u:v:w:x:y:z) \mapsto (-x:-y:-z : u:v:w).
  $$
  For a general choice of the quadrics $P_i, Q_i$, this involution acts freely (i.e.\ no fixed points). Then the quotient
  $$ S := X / \langle \iota \rangle $$
  is an Enriques surface. In particular, $\pi^*K_S = K_X = \mathcal O_X$, so $K_S$ is the nontrivial 2-torsion class in $\mathrm{NS}(S)$.

(There are other explicit constructions too — e.g.\ using K3 double planes or double covers of $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$ arranged so that a natural involution is fixed-point-free — but the principle is the same: a free involution on a K3 gives an Enriques quotient with a 2-torsion canonical class.)

---

### 4) Reading the Néron–Severi lattice in this example

For any Enriques surface $S$ (char $\neq 2$),
$$\mathrm{NS}(S) \cong \big(E_8(-1) \oplus U\big) \oplus \underbrace{\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z}_{\langle K_S \rangle},$$
so the *unique* torsion is generated by the canonical class. Equivalently, the numerical Néron–Severi lattice $\mathrm{Num}(S)$ is torsion-free and equals $E_8(-1)\oplus U$.

---

**Takeaway.** The Enriques surface $S = X / \langle \iota \rangle$, constructed from a K3 surface $X$ with a fixed-point-free involution $\iota$, is the standard explicit example of a surface whose Néron–Severi group has a $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ torsion factor, namely the canonical class $K_S$. The rest of $\mathrm{NS}(S)$ is the even unimodular lattice $E_8(-1)\oplus U$ of rank 10.

If you like, I can also give you an even more concrete coordinate example or check intersection pairings on $S$.
