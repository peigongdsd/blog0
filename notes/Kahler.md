# Basics on Kähler Manifolds

# Riemann Metric, Hermitian Metric and Kähler Form

For a (real) manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, the tangent bundle is denoted by $\mathrm{T}M$ while the tangent space at a point $x \in M$ is denoted by $\mathrm{T}_xM$.
A Riemann metric $g$ associates to every point $x \in M$ a positive definite symmetric inner product $$g_x:\mathrm{T}_xM \times \mathrm{T}_xM \to \mathbb{R}$$
in a smooth way. Locally around $x$ choose set of bases $$\{\partial_{x_1}, \partial_{x_2}, \ldots, \partial_{x_n}\}$$ the riemann metric $g$ is then written as $$g=g_{ij}\mathrm{d}x^i\otimes\mathrm{d}x^j$$ where $g_{ij}=g_{ji}$ varies smoothly along any smooth chart.

For a complex manifold $A$ of complex dimension $n$ (therefore of real dimension $2n$), the *complexified* tangent space is the tensor product of the (real) tangent space with $\mathbb{C}$, namely

$$ \mathrm{T}_\mathbb{C}M=\mathrm{T}M\otimes\mathbb{C}. $$

There is an associated linear operation $J$ acting on $TM$ over $M$ such that $J^2=-1$, which represents the so-called *almost complex structure*. The tangent space $\mathrm{T}_xM$ is then decomposed into eigen spaces $$\mathrm{T}_xM=\mathrm{T}_xM^{1,0}\oplus\mathrm{T}_xM^{0,1}$$ where $\mathrm{T}_xM^{1,0}$ is the space of vectors $v$ such that $Jv=\mathrm{i}v$ and $\mathrm{T}_xM^{0,1}$ is the space of vectors $v$ such that $Jv=-\mathrm{i}v$. Now the local choice of (real) bases is denoted by $$\{\partial_{z_1}, \partial_{z_2}, \ldots, \partial_{z_n}, \partial_{\bar{z_1}}, \partial_{\bar{z_2}}, \ldots, \partial_{\bar{z_n}}\}.$$

$$ \mathrm{T}_M\hookrightarrow \mathrm{T}M\otimes\mathbb{C}=\mathrm{T}^{1,0}\oplus\mathrm{T}^{0,1} $$


In this case, a *Hermitian metric* $h$ turns the tangent space to each point $x\in M$ into a Hermitian space (with respect to the almost complex structure $J$). The action of $h$ is calculated as $$h()$$
This amounts to say
